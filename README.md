## Description
This project, hosted on Heroku, is a simple note taker app that uses express.js to get, post, and delete notes on a webpage. The notes have titles which are displayed on the left panel, and a body which can be viewed in the main panel when the title is clicked on. To write a new note, click on the pencil icon. Once a title and body are added, a save icon appears next to the pencil which saves the note and adds it to the left panel. The delete buttons on each item can be clicked to delete an item.
